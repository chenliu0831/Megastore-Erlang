* Motivation

 gen_paxos is an implementation of the Paxos protocol for Erlang/OTP. Paxos
 implementation is to be a large finite state machine. My motivation is to
 reduce the cost of re-invention of wheels.  PAXOS is a consensus method in
 distributed and masterless environment, which is mathmatically guaranteed to
 come to a conclusion in a finite amount of time.


* Current status

 UNDER DEVELOPMENT:
 Prototype of paxos consensus protocol (paxos_fsm) has successfully worked,
 but there is major work still to do before this is viable for production
 use.  See "future work" below for the list.


* Usage

 With setting (1)Name of Subject, (2)Identity Number in PAXOS group, (3)Value
 that PAXOS agent will propose, and (4)Other PAXOS agents into
 paxos_fsm:start/4, PAXOS consensus IPC (part-time parliament) starts. With
 calling paxos_fsm:get_result/1 you'll get result of the parliament. With
 calling paxos_fsm:stop/1 you'll garbage-collect the part-time parliament.

** Example
- in node A:
 nodeA> node().
 'nodeA'.
 nodeA> nodes().
 ['nodeB'].
 nodeA> gen_paxos:start_link( 0, nodes() ).
 nodeA> gen_paxos:ask( somekey, somevalue ).
 ...(paxos consensus protocol started; messages will be printed)...
 paxos mediation done. decided: hogehoge - (N=2)
 nodeA> gen_paxos:stop().
 paxos_fsm terminated (normal).
 ok
 StateName: decided
 StateData: ....
 nodeA>

- in node B:
 nodeB> node().
 'nodeB'.
 nodeB> nodes().
 ['nodeA'].
 nodeB> gen_paxos:start_link( 1, nodes() ).
 ...(paxos consensus protocol started; messages will be printed)...
 paxos mediation done. decided: hogehoge - (N=2)
 nodeB> gen_paxos:ask( somekey, void ).
 somevalue
 nodeB>


* Future Work

 - replace use of disterl with UDP sockets
 - 2-phase paxos consensus algorithm works, but not so fast as other
   replication/consensus protocols.
 - to refine the code so as to work as a generic erlang module - deprecated.
 - automation of basic tests.
 - to expand coverege of tested combinations of states.
   - because paxos is complex FSM as a whole
 - to create a gen_leader[2] compatible interface?
 - gen_serverize
 - master election module with lease time, with replication consistency
 - performance test
 - quick check
 - dialyzer
 - documentation :P


* Related works

 - libpaxos ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/libpaxos ) libpaxos is almost
 same implementation of PAXOS consensus protocol. It has Simple version and
 Fast version of paxos and seems well working. Its implementation has paxos
 coordinator process, SPOF in a really distributed environment, which is solved
 in gen_paxos.

 - gen_leader ( http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~hanssv/leader_election/ ) gen_leader
 is a master election module whose behaviour looks like gen_server.  It's
 siginificant in churn environment (maybe) and small rate of mis-election,
 controllability with proirity. Valid information and details are in [2].
